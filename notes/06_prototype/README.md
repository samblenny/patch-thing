# 06 Prototype

Before I start soldering and drilling holes, I suppose it would be sensible to
write CircuitPython code for a breadboard and flying wire prototype that talks
MIDI CC to a software synth patch.

My goal is a MIDI control surface for tactile control of software synth signal
routing with similar aesthetics to analog modular synths, but at a much lower
cost. My working plan is to scan a grid of 3.5mm patch points, translate the
resulting graph of patch cable connections into MIDI CC messages, then write
synth patches that can use MIDI CC to do adaptive signal routing.

The main risk I see for this scheme is that making a software synth patch that
can adapt its signal routing in response to MIDI CC messages may be much harder
than I expect. I think it will be a bit of a challenge, but it might actually
turn out to be really hard.

If I can't effectively make use of MIDI CC messages in a software synth patch,
then maybe I should adjust my plan for the controller build to focus more on
switches and knobs.


## Breadboard Circuit

![Breadboard with Feather M4 Express, 10k resistors, and wires](breadboard-feather-M4-10k.jpeg)

The point of this circuit layout was to make an area on the right side of the
board where I can use flying wires (DuPont wires) to simulate a grid of patch
points using 3.5mm jacks.

I connected 5 IO pins on each side of the Adafruit Feather M4 Express board
using 10kÎ© resistors for a little protection against ESD and accidental shorts.
The piece of black hookup wire on row 24 of the breadboard is to mark the left
edge of the patch panel area.

This is how I've connected the Feather M4 pins:

| M4 Pin | Breadboard row | Comment                 |
| ------ | -------------- | ----------------------- |
|     A0 | -       | use for synthio or knob? |
|     A1 | -       | use for synthio or knob? |
|     A2 | -       | use for knob/button/switch? |
|     A3 | -       | use for knob/button/switch? |
|     A4 | -       | use for knob/button/switch? |
|     A5 | -       | use for knob/button/switch? |
|    SCK | -       | use for additional patch point? |
|     MO | 29, a-e | Bottom Right of patch panel area |
|     MI | 28, a-e | |
|     RX | 27, a-e | |
|     TX | 26, a-e | |
|     D4 | 25, a-e | Bottom Left of patch panel area |
|    SDA | -       | use for I2C GPIO or ADC expanders? |
|    SCL | -       | use for I2C GPIO or ADC expanders? |
|      5 | 25, f-j | Top Left of patch panel area | |
|      6 | 26, f-j | |
|      9 | 27, f-j | |
|     10 | 28, f-j | |
|     11 | 29, f-j | Top Right of patch panel area |
|     12 | -       | use for additional patch point? |
|     13 | -       | use for indicator LED? |

## CircuitPython Code

### Update CircuitPython

CAUTION; Following these instructions will erase any existing code on your
Feather M4 Express.

These path and shell commands below are for Terminal on macOS.

1. Download latest version of Feather M4 CircuitPython (currently 9.0.4) uf2
   file from: https://circuitpython.org/board/feather_m4_express/

2. Install CircuitPython using the bootloader, following the instructions from
   the Adafruit Learn Guide, [Adafruit Feather M4 Express &gt; CircuitPython on Feather M4 Express](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-m4-express-atsamd51/circuitpython)

3. Download CircuitPython library bundle to match CircuitPython version from:
   https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/

   The full library set is too big to fit on the M4 Express CIRCUITPY drive, so
   you will need to copy specific libraries into the CIRCUITPY/lib/ folder.

   Refer to the Adafruit Learn Guide,
   [Adafruit Feather M4 Express &gt; CircuitPython Libraries](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-m4-express-atsamd51/circuitpython-libraries)

4. Expand the library bundle:

   ```
   $ cd Downloads
   $ unzip adafruit-circuitpython-bundle-9.x-mpy-20240514
   ```

5. Install adafruit_midi library:

   ```
   $ mkdir -p /Volumes/CIRCUITPY/lib
   $ cd /Downloads/adafruit-circuitpython-bundle-9.x-mpy-20240514
   $ cp -r lib/adafruit_midi /Volumes/CIRCUITPY/lib/
   ```


### Code to scan jacks and send MIDI CC

To enable USB MIDI on the Feather M4 Express, put this in [boot.py](boot.py):

```
import usb_hid, usb_midi

usb_hid.disable()
usb_midi.enable()
```

Then, put this in [code.py](code.py):
```
from board import D4, D5, D6, D9, D10, D11, TX, RX, MISO, MOSI

  an RC network? It seems marginally better behaved if I leave
  un-involved pins HIGH-Z during measurements and drain stray charge
  before and after.
  Pros: resistors are cheap protection from shorts and also provide
        some (very limited) ESD protection
  Cons: seems to need management of stray charge to get good inputs

## Software Synth Patch

This is a basic Faust dsp patch (also available as
[cc-receiver.dsp](cc-receiver.dsp)) that you can copy and paste into the
[Faust web IDE](https://faustide.grame.fr/). I tested this with Chrome
on macOS. FWIW, some places claim that Web MIDI only works on Chrome.

Anyhow, if you run the boot.py and code.py above on a Feather M4 (or other
suitable board), and if Web MIDI works in your browser, you should see the name
of the board you are using in the "MIDI Input" control in the right sidebar of
the Faust IDE.

This is the Faust dsp code:

```
// This MIDI CC decoder listens to 5 MIDI CC controls, where the value of each
// control represents the graph edges from one "output jack" to each of 5
// possible "input jacks". For example, cc16 == 5 (0b00101) means output D4 is
// connected to inputs D11 (0b00001) and D9 (0b00100)

declare options "[midi:on]";
import("stdfaust.lib");
cc16 = nentry("16[midi:ctrl 16]",0,0,127,1);
cc17 = nentry("17[midi:ctrl 17]",0,0,127,1);
cc18 = nentry("18[midi:ctrl 18]",0,0,127,1);
cc19 = nentry("19[midi:ctrl 19]",0,0,127,1);
cc20 = nentry("20[midi:ctrl 20]",0,0,127,1);
graph = (cc16 | cc17 | cc18 | cc19 | cc20);
process = hgroup("cc", no.pink_noise/6*graph) <: _,_;
```

When it runs, it looks like this:

![Faust Web IDE with running code](faust-web-ide.png)

As you change connections on the patch panel area of your breadboard, you
should see the numbers change in the `cc16` to `cc20` number entry UI
elements. The volume of the audio (pink noise) will also change in response to
the OR of all the CC values.
